**collector** is an R package for conducting interviews with subject matter 
experts (SMEs) on the risk scenarios facing an organization. It offers 
functions for the following stages of input collection:

 - generate scenario and capability questions
 - building interview artifacts, including progress card, slide decks, and handouts
 - calibration testing, similar to that promoted by Doug Hubbard and the FAIR Institute
 - opinion pooling
 - distribution fitting
 - generating quantitative data structures for simulation and further reporting by [Evaluator](https://evaluator.tidyrisk.org)

## Installation

Collector is not currently on CRAN. The following sample code to install will 
not work until a release is made to CRAN.

```{r install_cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("collector")
```

If you wish to run the development (and potentially bleeding edge) version of 
Collector, you can install directly from GitHub via the following `devtools` 
command.

```{r github_install, eval=FALSE}
# install.pacakges("devtools")
devtools::install_github("davidski/collector")
```

## Basic Flow

See the [package website](https://collector.tidyrisk.org) for 
reference. While long form vignettes need to be created, the basic flow for 
preparing for interviews with your SMEs, processing the results, and 
generating parameters for simulation via 
[evaluator](https://evaluator.tidyrisk.org) is:

1. Build questions and define SME expertise

2. Read in the questions

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    library(collector)
   
    questions <- read_questions()
    ```
   
3. Generate materials for interviewing a SME

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    make_handouts("Leader Name", questions, output_dir)
    make_scorecard("Leader Name", questions, output_dir)
    make_slides("Leader Name", questions, output_dir)
    ```
    
4. Read in the answers from your SMEs

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    answers <- read_answers()
    scenario_answers <- answers$sce_ans
    capability_answers <- answers$cap_ans
    ```

5. Fit the SME answers to distributions.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    scenario_answers_fitted <- fit_scenarios(scenario_answers)
    capability_answers_fitted <- fit_capabilities(capability_answers)
    ```
    
6. Combine distributions into final parameters, applying weighting based on each SMEs level of calibration.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    scenario_parameters <- combine_scenario_parameters(scenario_answers_fitted)
    capability_parameters <- combine_capability_parameters(capability_answers_fitted)
    ```
    
7. Build quantitative parameters for `evaluator`

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    scenarios <- prepare_data(scenario_parameters, capability_parameters, 
                              threat_parameters, questions)
    ```
