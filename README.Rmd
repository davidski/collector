**collector** is an R package for conducting interviews with subject matter 
experts (SMEs) on the risk scenarios facing an organization. It offers 
functions for the following stages of input collection:

 - generate scenario and capability questions
 - building interview artifacts, including progress card, slide decks, and handouts
 - calibration testing, similar to that promoted by Doug Hubbard and the FAIR Institute
 - opinion pooling
 - distribution fitting
 - generating quantitative data structures for simulation and further reporting by [Evaluator](https://evaluator.severski.net)


## Installation

Collector is not currently on CRAN. The following sample code to install will 
not work until a release is made to CRAN.

```{r install_cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("collector")
```

If you wish to run the development (and potentially bleeding edge) version of 
Collector, you can install directly from Github via the following `devtools` 
command.

```{r github_install, eval=FALSE}
# install.pacakges("devtools")
devtools::install_github("davidski/collector", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Basic Flow

Documentation is still very much a pending To Do. Until documentation is 
authored, use the [package website](https://collector.severski.net) for 
reference. The flow for running interviews and sending along to 
[evaulator](https://evaluator.severski.net) is:

1. Build questions and define SME expertise

2. Read in the data

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    library(collector)
   
    dat <- read_data(source_dir)
    calibration <- dat$calibration
    domains <- dat$domains
    scenarios <- dat$scenarios
    capabilities <- dat$capabilities
    expertise <- dat$expertise
    ```
   
3. Generate slides

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    make_handouts("Leader Name", calibrarion, domains, expertise, scenarios, capabilities, output_dir)
    make_bingo("Leader Name", domains, expertise, output_dir)
    make_slides("Leader Name", source_dir, output_dir)
    ```
    
4. Input answers

5. Fit SME answers
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    scenario_answers_fitted <- fit_scenarios(scenario_answers)
    capability_answers_fitted <- (capability_answers)
    ```
    
6. Combined distributions into final parameters
    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    scenario_parameters <- combine_scenario_parameters(scenario_answers_fitted)
    capability_parameters <- combine_capability_parameters(capability_answers_fitted)
    ```
    
7. Build quantitative parameters for `Evaluator`
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    prepare_data(scenario_parameters, capability_parameters, threat_parameters, 
                 scenarios, domains)
    ```
