# collector 0.0.0.9000

* Begin initial documentation build out.
* Reference CRAN versions of `xaringan`.
* `read_questions()` replaces poorly named `read_data()` function.
* `make_slides()` properly escapes Unicode for the default title slide.
* `check_readability()` now uses the CRAN-published `quanteda` library in 
place of the archived `readability` library.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
