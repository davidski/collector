Make the following assumptions/modifications
  - minimum capacity is 5% (we've thought about it - 90% CI)
  - maximum capacity is 95% (we're just about the best - 90% CI)
  - minimum loss is 1000 dollars (both low and high)
  - scale all impact into thousands of dollars (make normal
      decomposition easier, and is in line of the scale of
      a strategic analysis)
  - set a minimum frequency of once per 10 years (0.1)
